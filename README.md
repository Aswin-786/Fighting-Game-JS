# Fighting-Game-JS

🎮 Just built a two-player fighting game with JavaScript! 💥💪

👥 Players can enter their names and then battle it out using strike and heal actions. The maximum health is 100, and the game includes a stimulate button that generates a random winner. For convenience, there's also a reset button to start over.

💻 I used object-oriented programming concepts to design and code the game, which helped me better understand how to organize code and create reusable components.

📈 Overall, this project challenged me to think creatively and put my JavaScript skills into practice. It was a fun way to learn more about programming and game development. Check it out and let me know what you think!
